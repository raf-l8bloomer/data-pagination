## What's the Deal with Functions?

### Intro

Functions are central to a developer’s work.  They’re often used like short task handlers that accomplish repeated jobs, and when combined with function parameters and arguments, can be used and reused in multiple situations.  The upcoming project will require these techniques.  Here's some lightweight practice creating simple functions and programming them with parameters and arguments.

### Instructions
